	<h1>Maintenancel optimization</h1>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The  infrastructure  manager  seeks  to  determine  the  best  possible  mainte-nance   plan.   As   maintenance   plans   resulting   in   less   deteriorated   struc-tures  also  lead  to  higher  costs,  the  manager   typically   faces   conflicting   objectives that must be simultaneously considered.   Given   the   deterioration   and  maintenance  models,  the  optimal  maintenance  planning  is  posed  as  an  optimization   problem   with   multiple   objectives  and  solved  by  multi-objec-tive   optimization.   In   multi-objective   optimization,  there  are  the  decision  and  the  objective  spaces.  The  search  must   be   performed   in   both   these   spaces.  To  do  this,  a  genetic  algorithm  was adopted within the framework of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D. As genetic operators, a two-point cross-over and uniform mutation are used. A  potential  solution  to  the  problem  representing  a  maintenance  schedule  for  an  infrastructure  asset  is  encoded  by  a  chromosome  as  a  sequence  of  integers, where the position defines the time of application and the value rep-resents  the  identification  number  (id)  of the maintenance action.</p>
	<p>As  an  example,  consider  the  follow-ing  string  \([5  0  7  1  6  0  2  5  9  4]\).  This  string   represents   the   timetable   of   maintenance   actions   for   10   years.   Each  action  is  denoted  by  the  integer  ranging  from  1  to  9,  including  0  for no action to be applied. Thus, 5 at the first position means that the main-tenance  action  of  type  5  is  applied  in  the first year, 0 at the second position means that no action is applied in the second  year  and  so  on.  If  an  asset  is  composed   of   multiple   components,   the  schedule  for  the  asset  is  defined  by  combining  the  schedules  for  its  individual components. The objectives are  to  minimize  both  the  worst  con-dition  state  of  asset  and  cumulative  cost  of  maintenance.  The  future  costs  are discounted to reflect their current values  using  the  concept  of  the  time  value of money.</p>
	<p>An   effective   maintenance   strategy   must  ensure  adequate  levels  of  safety  and  serviceability.  These  requirements  can be expressed by imposing an upper bound  on  the  asset  condition  state.  Thus,  a  feasible  maintenance  sched-ule  is  the  one  which  guarantees  that  the  user  specified  threshold,  c∈,  is  not  crossed  when  the  given  maintenance  actions  are  applied  during  the  consid-ered  period  of  time.  To  guarantee  the  feasibility  of  generated  solutions  dur-ing  the  search,  a  constraint  handling  technique based on a repair method is developed.  The  method  works  as  fol-lows.  A  sampling  matrix  used  in  the  Monte Carlo simulation is filled by col-umns. Each column is used to estimate the  condition  state  in  the  correspond-ing year. The main idea of the method is to prevent the condition state in the (j + 1)-th year, calculated by averaging the  (j  +  1)-th  column  of  the  sampling  matrix,  from  crossing  the  predefined  threshold, c∈, given the condition state and   the   maintenance   action   in   the   j-th  year.  When  the  column  in  S  corresponding  to  the  (j  +  1)-th  year  is  sampled,  the  condition  state  is  com-puted  by  averaging  the  values  in  this  column and compared with the thresh-old value. If c(j + 1) > c∈ then an integer encoding  a  maintenance  type  is  ran-domly generated and the sampling for the  (j  +  1)-th  year  is  performed  once  again,  with  the  corresponding  main-tenance  taking  place  in  the  j-th  year.  This  process  continues  until  a  feasible  condition  state  is  generated  for  the  (j + 1)-th year.</p>
	<p>The  idea  of  the  proposed  constraint  handling   technique   is   illustrated   in   Fig. 3. The first column of the sampling matrix, S, is initialized using input data, i.e.,  the  initial  condition  state.  Given  the  type  of  maintenance  action  5  for  the first year, the second column of the matrix S  is  sampled.  Once  it  is  done,  the  predicted  condition  state  in  the  second  planning  year  is  calculated.  In  Fig. 3,  it  is  within  the  acceptable  level  (c2 < c∈), so the first gene of the chro-mosome remains unchanged. Based on the sampled values for the second year and  the  type  of  maintenance  0,  sam-pling  for  the  third  year  is  performed.  Having  sampled  the  third  column  of  S,  the  condition  state  c3  is  computed.  In this case, it violates the value of c∈. Thus, the second gene must be repaired. To do this, an integer is randomly gen-erated  from  the  set  of  action  indexes  {0, ..., na},  where  na  is  used  to  denote  the  number  of  maintenance  actions.  Then,  the  sampling  for  the  third  year  is repeated until c2≤c∈, and so on for the remaining columns of S</p>
